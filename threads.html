        <p>ThreadsByNoah is a vintage resale business I started in December of 2021. 
            <br><br>
            In a year time I generated around $10,000 dollars in revenue selling at local vendor fairs and online. <br><br>
            This experience combined my passions for entrepeneurship and fashion. <br><br>
            I learned a lot about digital marketing, sales, and graphic design. <br><br>
            At the tail end of my vendor fairs I got the chance to sell my own custom shirts! <br><br>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>I learned that I am an entrepeneur! <br><br>
        In the future I hope to create a new business and make that my sole income.<br><br>
        I learned that hobbies and following your interests is a thousand times more rewarding than traditional work. <br><br>
        I hope to continue designing in every facet of my life. <br><br>
        I learned so many skills such as designing, marketing, photoshop, sales, data analysis, hustle, etc. <br><br>
        This experience taught me more about myself than any class or school could.<br><br></p>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>After school I hope to continue my passion for business by starting a direct to consumer fashion brand <br><br>
        I'm not sure what niche I will fill yet, but I am excited to get working.<br><br></p>
